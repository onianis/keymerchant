# keymerchant - The Python Keylogger

## Overview
**keymerchant** is a proof-of-concept keylogger developed for offensive security research and educational purposes. It is written completely in Python and implements realistic monitoring capabilities to serve as an effective research tool for cybersecurity professionals, purple / red team operators, and security researchers.

The project focuses and will focus on implementing features that mirror real-world surveillance software. This realistic approach ensures that security professionals can study and defend against actual threat patterns rather than sanitized academic examples.

Future development will continue expanding the feature set to maintain research relevance, including enhanced operational security measures, improved cross-platform compatibility, and advanced persistence mechanisms - all designed to provide comprehensive learning opportunities for authorized security research and defensive strategy development.
